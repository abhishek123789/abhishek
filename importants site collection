Step 1: you need to send the data from the text box to your back end/server. Perhaps a form submit or simple HTTP POST request with the data in the body. To do the form submit, you can look into using a <form> element with an "action" attribute in addition to perhaps a button within the form with the submit attribute. The action attribute on the form element should be the URL your server expects the data to be sent to.

Step 2: once data is received as a part of a POST request on the server side, you need to use a connection to the database to save the data into the database.

Definitely more that two steps in actuality but this is the overall gist of it.
